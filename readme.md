## Coverage measurement

### Existing tool

coverage,py 
It is executed by running the following commands: 
tox
coverage run -m tox
coverage report
Coverage xml 
Screenshot of total coverage results in the coverage.xml file, to include screenshots of the whole  xml file would make it too large, but along the coverage report we used this to see branch coverage per function
